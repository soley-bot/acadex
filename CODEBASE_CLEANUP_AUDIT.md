# Codebase Cleanup Audit - September 11, 2025

## 🔍 Comprehensive Dependency Analysis

### Current Working Systems ✅
- QuizBuilder.tsx (optimized, working)
- Admin dashboard and quiz management
- Course management system
- Authentication and user management
- Database connections and API routes

### Audit Methodology
1. **Dependency Analysis**: Check imports and usage across codebase
2. **File Age Analysis**: Identify outdated/temporary files
3. **Component Conflict Detection**: Find overlapping functionality
4. **Safe Deletion Identification**: Files with zero dependencies
5. **Risk Assessment**: High/Medium/Low risk for each cleanup action

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before each phase:
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to verify no breaking changes
- [ ] Grep search for any missed dependencies  
- [ ] Commit changes for rollback safety
- [ ] Test critical functionality (QuizBuilder, admin interface)

After cleanup:
- [ ] Bundle size reduction verification
- [ ] Performance improvement measurement
- [ ] Clean git status with reduced file count
- [ ] Updated documentation reflecting current architecture
