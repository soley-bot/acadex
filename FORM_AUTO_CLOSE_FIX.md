# Form Auto-Close Issue Fix

## Problem
The Enhanced Course Form was closing abruptly after successful course updates, which was confusing for users who wanted to continue editing or see the success confirmation.

## Root Cause Analysis
There were **two separate mechanisms** automatically closing the form:

### 1. Form Component Auto-Close (EnhancedAPICourseForm.tsx)
```tsx
// OLD CODE - Auto-closed after 1.5 seconds
setSuccess('Course updated successfully!')
setTimeout(() => {
  onSuccess()
  onClose()  // This closed the modal automatically
}, 1500)
```

### 2. Parent Component Auto-Close (page.tsx)
```tsx
// OLD CODE - Also closed the form when onSuccess was called
const handleFormSuccess = () => {
  fetchCourses() // Refresh courses after successful form submission
  setShowCourseForm(false)  // This also closed the modal!
  setEditingCourse(null)
}
```

The form was being closed by **both** the form component AND the parent component, creating a confusing user experience.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Success Message in Form
- ✅ Removed automatic modal close timeout
- ✅ Enhanced success message with clear instructions
- ✅ Added dismissible success notification
- ✅ Users can continue editing or manually close

```tsx
// NEW CODE - No auto-close, better UX
setSuccess('Course updated successfully!')
onSuccess() // Still refresh the course list
// No automatic onClose() - user controls when to close

// Enhanced success message UI
<div className="flex items-center justify-between">
  <div className="flex items-center">
    <SvgIcon icon="check" size={20} className="text-green-600 mr-2" />
    <span className="text-green-800">{success}</span>
  </div>
  <div className="flex items-center space-x-2 text-sm">
    <span className="text-green-700">You can continue editing or close the form.</span>
    <button onClick={() => setSuccess(null)}>
      <SvgIcon icon="close" size={16} />
    </button>
  </div>
</div>
```

### 2. Parent Component Behavior Updated
```tsx
// NEW CODE - Only refresh data, don't auto-close
const handleFormSuccess = () => {
  fetchCourses() // Refresh courses after successful form submission
  // Don't auto-close the form - let users choose when to close
  // setShowCourseForm(false)
  // setEditingCourse(null)
}
```

## User Experience Improvements
