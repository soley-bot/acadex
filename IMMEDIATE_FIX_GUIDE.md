# Fix for ChunkLoadError and Database Issues

## üö® Immediate Actions Needed

### 1. Fix Development Server Issue

The error shows Next.js is trying to load chunks from port 3000, but your server is running on port 3001.

**Solution A - Use the correct URL:**
- Go to: **http://localhost:3001** (not 3000)
- Your server is running on port 3001

**Solution B - Force port 3000:**
```bash
# Kill the process using port 3000
lsof -ti :3000 | xargs kill -9

# Then restart development server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Database RLS Status

Run the `rls-diagnostic.sql` file in Supabase SQL Editor to check if RLS policies are working correctly.

This will show you:
- ‚úÖ Which tables have RLS enabled
- ‚úÖ Which policies exist
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Any missing policies
- ‚úÖ If you can access tables

### 3. Expected Outcomes

After running the diagnostic, you should see:
```
‚úÖ RLS Enabled for all tables
‚úÖ Multiple policies per table
‚úÖ Can access users table
‚úÖ Can access courses table
```

If you see any ‚ùå or ‚ö†Ô∏è messages, we'll need to fix those specific issues.

## Quick Test Steps

1. **Fix URL**: Go to http://localhost:3001 instead of localhost:3000
2. **Run diagnostic**: Copy `rls-diagnostic.sql` into Supabase SQL Editor
3. **Check results**: Look for any red ‚ùå messages
4. **Test login**: Try logging in with admin01@acadex.com
5. **Test course editing**: Try editing a course

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Development server is running (port 3001)
- ‚úÖ Database tables exist with RLS enabled
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to verify RLS policies are working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to test from correct URL

Let me know what you see when you:
1. Go to http://localhost:3001
2. Run the diagnostic query in Supabase
