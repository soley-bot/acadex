# Khmer AI Quiz Generation - Systematic Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ AIQuizGenerator Component - Wrong API Endpoint
**Problem**: Component was calling `/api/admin/generate-quiz` instead of enhanced API
**Fix Applied**: 
- Updated to call `/api/admin/generate-enhanced-quiz` with proper parameters
- Switched from `BaseQuizFormData` to `EnhancedQuizFormData` interface
- Added all required enhanced fields with appropriate defaults

### 2. ✅ Missing Explanation Language Support in UI
**Problem**: No explanation language selector in AI quiz generation form
**Fix Applied**:
- Added `explanationLanguage` field to form data with default 'khmer'
- Added LanguageSelector component for explanation language selection
- Added helpful description text for clarity

### 3. ✅ Quiz Edit Modal - Questions Not Loading
**Problem**: Quiz edit page was fetching quiz without related questions
**Fix Applied**:
- Updated database query to include `quiz_questions` with proper JOIN
- Added data transformation to map `quiz_questions` to `questions` property
- Fixed column name from `type` to `question_type` to match database schema

## Updated Components

### AIQuizGenerator.tsx
- **API Endpoint**: Now calls `/api/admin/generate-enhanced-quiz`
- **Form Interface**: Uses `EnhancedQuizFormData` with all required fields
- **Language Support**: Includes both content language and explanation language selectors
- **Enhanced Parameters**: Sends proper enhanced API parameters including:
  - `quizLanguage` and `explanationLanguage` 
  - `includeTranslations: true`
  - `teachingStyle: 'conversational'`
  - `includeExamples: true`

### Quiz Edit Page (/admin/quizzes/[id]/edit/page.tsx)
- **Database Query**: Now fetches quiz with related questions using JOIN
- **Data Transformation**: Maps `quiz_questions` to `questions` for component compatibility
- **Field Mapping**: Uses correct `question_type` field name

## Testing Steps

### For English Questions + Khmer Explanations:
1. Go to `/admin/quizzes/create`
2. Use AI Quiz Generator tab
3. Set Content Language to "English"
4. Set Explanation Language to "Khmer" 
5. Generate quiz and verify:
   - Questions are in English
   - Explanations are in Khmer (mixed with English as needed)
   - No JSON parsing errors

### For Quiz Edit Modal:
1. Go to `/admin/quizzes`
2. Click edit on any existing quiz
3. Verify questions load and display properly
4. Verify you can edit questions without errors

## Enhanced API Integration

The AIQuizGenerator now properly integrates with the enhanced AI services that include:
- **Mixed Language Validation**: Automatic validation for English+Khmer content
- **JSON Safety Checks**: Prevents parsing errors from mixed language content
- **Content Sanitization**: Cleans mixed language text for JSON compatibility
- **Enhanced Prompting**: Specialized prompts for mixed language explanations

## Expected Behavior

### Successful Generation:
- English questions with clear, grammatically correct text
- Khmer explanations that may include English terms when appropriate
- Proper JSON structure without parsing errors
- Questions save correctly to database

### Error Handling:
- JSON parsing errors should be caught and sanitized automatically
- Mixed language content validation prevents malformed responses
- Detailed error logging for debugging if issues occur

## Next Steps

1. **Test the workflow** with your specific English+Khmer use case
2. **Verify quiz edit modal** loads questions properly
3. **Check for any remaining JSON parsing errors** in the browser console
4. **Report any specific failures** for additional debugging

The system is now properly configured for your English questions + Khmer explanations workflow with robust error handling and validation.
