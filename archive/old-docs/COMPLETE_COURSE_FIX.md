// To custom icon:
<span className="text-green-600 mt-1">🎯</span>  // Target icon
<span className="text-green-600 mt-1">📚</span>  // Book icon
<span className="text-green-600 mt-1">⭐</span>  // Star icon
```

2. **Or use SVG Icons**:
```tsx
import { CheckCircle, Target, BookOpen } from 'lucide-react'

// Replace span with:
<CheckCircle className="w-4 h-4 text-green-600 mt-0.5" />
```

### **Icon Options**:
- 🎯 Target (for objectives)
