# Course Update Loading Issue - Debugging Guide

## Current Status
- âœ… Server running successfully
- âœ… TypeScript compilation passing  
- âœ… Enhanced error handling in mutations
- âœ… Added detailed logging for debugging

## Debugging Steps Applied

### 1. Fixed Cache Mutation Hook
- Moved `setIsLoading(false)` out of finally block
- Set loading state before callbacks to ensure immediate updates
- Improved error handling flow

### 2. Enhanced CourseForm Error Handling
- Added proper error catching and local error state
- Improved logging for debugging mutation flow
- Better error messages for users

### 3. Added Detailed Logging
- Database operation logging in `cachedCourseAPI.updateCourse`
- Mutation hook logging in `useCourseMutations`
- Form submission logging in `CourseForm.handleSubmit`

## Next Steps for Testing

### 1. Test Course Update
1. Open http://localhost:3000/admin/courses
2. Click "Edit" on any course
3. Make changes and click "Update Course" 
4. Check browser console for detailed logs

### 2. Look for These Log Messages
- `ðŸ”„ CourseForm handleSubmit - Starting submission`
- `ðŸ”„ useCacheMutation: Starting update for course [ID]`
- `ðŸ”„ Starting course update for ID: [ID]`
- `âœ… Course updated in database: [TITLE]`
- `âœ… useCacheMutation: Course updated successfully`

### 3. If Still Stuck on "Saving..."
Check for these potential issues:
- Network errors (check Network tab)
- Database permission errors (check console)
- Missing required fields
- Invalid data types

## Common Causes of "Saving..." Loop

1. **Async/Await Issues**: Fixed by improving mutation hook
2. **Error Handling**: Enhanced with better try-catch
3. **State Management**: Improved loading state timing
4. **Database Errors**: Added detailed logging to identify
5. **Cache Issues**: Enhanced cache invalidation

## If Problem Persists

1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Look at Network tab for failed requests
3. Verify Supabase connection and permissions
4. Check if learning_objectives array is causing issues
5. Test with minimal data (just title and description)

The enhanced logging should now provide clear insight into where the update process is failing.
