# Form Update Issues - Fixed! ✅

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Form Not Updating After Successful Save

**Problem**: After successfully saving course changes, the form would close immediately without showing the updated values to the user.

**Root Cause**: The `handleFormSuccess` callback in the parent component immediately closed the form and cleared the editing course state.

**Solution Applied**:

#### A. Modified Parent Component (`/src/app/admin/courses/page.tsx`):
```typescript
const handleFormSuccess = (updatedCourse?: Course) => {
  refetch() // Refetch data to update the UI
  
  // If editing and we have updated course data, update the editing course
  if (updatedCourse && editingCourse) {
    console.log('📝 [COURSES_PAGE] Updating editing course with new data:', updatedCourse.title)
    setEditingCourse(updatedCourse)
    // Keep form open to show the updated values
  } else {
    // For new courses, close the form
    setShowCourseForm(false)
    setEditingCourse(null)
  }
}
```

#### B. Updated Form Component (`/src/components/admin/CourseForm.tsx`):
```typescript
interface CourseFormProps {
  course?: Course
  isOpen: boolean
  onClose: () => void
  onSuccess: (updatedCourse?: Course) => void // Now accepts updated course data
}
```

#### C. Enhanced Form Submission Logic:
```typescript
if (course?.id) {
  // For updates, show success message and keep form open
  setSuccessMessage('Course updated successfully!')
  onSuccess(result) // Pass updated course data
} else {
  // For new courses, close the form
  onSuccess()
  onClose()
}
```

### 2. ✅ Added Success Message Display

**Enhancement**: Added visual feedback when course updates are successful.

**Implementation**:
- Added `successMessage` state to form component
- Success message displays with green styling and checkmark icon
- Message automatically clears when user starts making new changes
- Provides clear confirmation that changes were saved

### 3. ✅ Fixed Hydration Issues in Footer Component

**Problem**: Non-standard CSS classes causing hydration mismatches between server and client rendering.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced `text-muted-foreground` with `text-gray-600`
- Replaced `hover:text-foreground` with `hover:text-gray-900`  
- Replaced `bg-background` with `bg-white`
- Replaced `hover:bg-accent` with `hover:bg-gray-100`
- Replaced `bg-brand` with `bg-blue-600`
