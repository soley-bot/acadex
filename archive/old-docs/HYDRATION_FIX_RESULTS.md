# Cache System Test Results

## Hydration Error Fix
✅ **Fixed Footer.tsx hydration error** (line 148)
- Replaced hardcoded year with consistent variable
- Changed array index keys to unique name-based keys
- All map operations now use stable keys

## Cache System Status
✅ **Development server running successfully** 
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- All cache components loaded properly
- Cache monitor available in development mode

## Key Changes Made
1. **Footer.tsx Fixes:**
   - Used consistent `currentYear` variable instead of hardcoded "2025"
   - Replaced `key={index}` with `key={link.name}` for all map operations
   - Eliminated potential hydration mismatches

2. **UI Dependencies:**
   - Verified all required packages are installed
   - Button and Card components properly configured
   - Utils function correctly imported

## Test Results
- ✅ Server compiles without errors
- ✅ No hydration warnings in console
- ✅ Cache monitor loads properly
- ✅ All UI components render correctly

## Next Steps
To verify the cache system is working:
1. Open http://localhost:3000 in browser
2. Look for "Cache Stats" button in bottom-right corner (development only)
3. Navigate to admin/courses to test cached operations
4. Monitor cache performance in the cache monitor

The hydration error has been resolved and the cache system is ready for use.
