# Testing Form Update Fix

## Steps to Test:

1. **Open Admin Courses**: Go to http://localhost:3000/admin/courses
2. **Edit a Course**: Click "Edit" on any course
3. **Make a Change**: Change the title slightly (e.g., add " - Updated")
4. **Submit**: Click "Update Course"
5. **Check Results**:
   - Look for green success message: "Course updated successfully!"
   - Form should stay open
   - Title field should show the updated value
   - Check browser console for logs

## Expected Behavior:

### Before Fix:
- Form closes immediately after save
- No visual feedback about success
- User has to reopen form to see if changes were saved

### After Fix:
- ✅ Green success message appears
- ✅ Form stays open 
- ✅ Updated values visible in form fields
- ✅ Console shows detailed logging

## Debug Console Logs to Look For:

```
🎉 [COURSE_FORM] Operation completed successfully, calling callbacks...
🎉 [COURSE_FORM] Calling onSuccess() with updated course data...
📝 [COURSES_PAGE] Updating editing course with new data: [TITLE]
```

## If It's Not Working:

1. **Check Browser Console** for errors
2. **Verify Network Tab** shows successful API calls
3. **Check Form State** - does the form data update?
4. **Verify Cache** - is the course cache being updated?

## Current Status:
- Dev server: ✅ Running on http://localhost:3000
- Form changes: ✅ Applied to CourseForm.tsx
- Parent handler: ✅ Updated in page.tsx
- Success message: ✅ Added to UI
