## 🚀 Deployment Requirements

### Database Migration
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Located at: database/add-question-type-support.sql
ALTER TABLE quiz_questions 
ADD COLUMN question_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'multiple_choice' CHECK (question_type IN ('multiple_choice', 'true_false', 'fill_blank'));
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Google AI API Key (for production)
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Dependencies
All required dependencies already present:
- `@google/generative-ai`: AI integration
