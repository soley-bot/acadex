# 🚀 Acadex Refactoring Sprint
## 7-Day Development Productivity Transformation

**Sprint Dates**: September 19-26, 2025  
**Goal**: Transform 2020-line components into manageable, testable pieces  
**Success Metric**: 5x faster development velocity

## 🎯 **GAME CHANGER: Mantine Migration Strategy**

### 🚀 **NEW PRIORITY: Combine Refactoring + UI Library Upgrade**
**Decision Made:** Migrate from Shadcn to Mantine during refactoring for **maximum impact!**

📋 **Start Here:** `MANTINE_MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md` - Complete roadmap

**Why This Changes Everything:**
- 🎨 **100+ components** vs Shadcn's ~20 basic ones
- 📝 **Built-in forms** - Replace complex custom logic with useForm
- 🎯 **Drag & drop** - Built-in vs 200+ lines of custom code  
- 🔔 **Modals/notifications** - Zero custom implementations needed
- ⚡ **60-90% code reduction** in largest components

## 📋 Sprint Overview

### 🎯 **Primary Mission**
Break down the massive `QuizBuilder.tsx` (2020 lines) that's killing your development productivity.

### 🔄 **NEW: Code Deduplication Focus**
**Major Win Achieved:** Eliminated 65+ lines of duplicate validation logic in QuizBuilder!

**Strategy**: Extract large files AND consolidate duplicate code patterns simultaneously for maximum impact.

### 📅 **7-Day Timeline**

| Day | Focus | Deliverable | Impact |
|-----|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Day 1** | Setup Mantine + QuizBuilder analysis | Mantine working + Extraction plan | Foundation ready |
| **Day 2** | Migrate inputs + Extract QuizSettingsStep | First step with Mantine components | 25% progress |
| **Day 3** | Forms migration + Extract QuestionsStep | useForm + Questions isolated | 50% progress |
| **Day 4** | DnD + modals + Extract hooks | Mantine DnD + State separated | 75% progress |
| **Day 5** | Complete migration + Extract remaining | All Mantine + All pieces working | 95% progress |
| **Day 6** | CourseForm breakdown + Mantine | CourseForm with Mantine forms | Momentum |
| **Day 7** | Testing & documentation | Everything tested & documented | Complete |

## 🔥 **Sprint Rules**

### ✅ **DO**
- Focus on ONE component at a time
- Test each extraction immediately
- Keep the original component working during extraction
- Ask for help if stuck for more than 2 hours
- Celebrate small wins daily

### ❌ **DON'T**
- Try to refactor everything at once
- Add new features during the sprint
- Skip testing extracted components
- Work on other refactoring tasks
- Give up when it gets complex

---

## 💪 **Daily Motivation**

**Remember**: Every line you extract makes the codebase easier for:
- ✨ You (faster development)
- ✨ Your team (easier reviews) 
- ✨ Future you (maintainable code)
- ✨ New developers (understandable components)

**Current State**: 2020 lines of complexity  
**Goal State**: 8 focused, testable components  
**Impact**: From weeks to understand → minutes to understand
